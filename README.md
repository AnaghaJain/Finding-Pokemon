# Finding-Pokemon
Machine learning model to analyze dataset and classify characters using different classification techniques like KNN and Logistic Regression.

This is the link to my finding pokemon project: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11H3dI4ED2VHWxw-wPJ1K-iwBCuzkhVZ-?usp=sharing
(It uses collab notebooks and the dataset that I have made used of, is given below)

Using the pokemon dataset, I have implemented algorithms - KNN and Logistic Regression for image classification.

The conclusion of this project being as follows: The Logistic Regression has an accuracy of 0.97368 while the KNN Algorithm has an accuracy of 0.77631. 
This shows that Logistic Regression is a better algorithm than KNN for this particular problem of image classification.
